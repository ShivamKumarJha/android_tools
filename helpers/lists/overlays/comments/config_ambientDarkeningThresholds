    <!-- Array of hysteresis constraint values for darkening, represented as tenths of a
         percent. The length of this array is assumed to be one greater than
         config_ambientThresholdLevels. The darkening threshold is calculated as
         lux * (1.0f - CONSTRAINT_VALUE). When the current lux is lower than this threshold,
         the screen brightness is recalculated. See the config_ambientThresholdLevels
         description for how the constraint value is chosen. -->
